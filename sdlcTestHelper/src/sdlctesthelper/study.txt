Success may be measured by answering the following questions:%    Does the project solve what it was meant to solve?%   Is it easy to maintain and administer?%   Is it scalable to meet the needs of the client?%  Is there a successful support system in place for the client?%    Was it delivered on time and ready to go?%    Was the client happy with the finished product%
Creating high-quality software involves organization, planning and utilizing various diagrammatic conventions.%   Computer scientists have created a view of the software development process known as the ‘software development life cycle’ (SDLC)%    One method is known as the ‘waterfall model’ - A mistake made in one phase often requires the developer to backup and redo some of the work in the previous phas%
The Waterfall Model - Developed by Dr Winston Royce in 1970 based on his experience developing software for spacecraft mission planning%  The Waterfall Model consists of several phases:%  Problem Statement, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Integration /Test, Maintenance%
Mistakes found early in the SDLC are much less expensive to correct than those found later%
The cost of developing software is not spread equally over the phases, Maintenance is the most costly%
Project Management Tools: Gantt Chart, UML, Daily Log, Weekly Report%
Gantt Chart:% Developed by mechanical engineer Henry Gantt in the 1910’s%   Tool typically used by people working on a large project like the Hoover Dam% Helps project managers to visualize, schedule, and track scheduled as well as actual progress of project%
UML (Unified Modeling Language):% Visually specifies parts of a system% Complex software designs are much more easily described through UML than textually%
