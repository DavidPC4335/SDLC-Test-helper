Success may be measured by answering the following questions: \n    Does the project solve what it was meant to solve? \n   Is it easy to maintain and administer? \n   Is it scalable to meet the needs of the client? \n  Is there a successful support system in place for the client? \n    Was it delivered on time and ready to go? \n    Was the client happy with the finished product?\n
Creating high-quality software involves organization, planning and utilizing various diagrammatic conventions. \n   Computer scientists have created a view of the software development process known as the ‘software development life cycle’ (SDLC) \n    One method is known as the ‘waterfall model’ - A mistake made in one phase often requires the developer to backup and redo some of the work in the previous phase\n
The Waterfall Model - Developed by Dr Winston Royce in 1970 based on his experience developing software for spacecraft mission planning \n  The Waterfall Model consists of several phases: \n  Problem Statement, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Integration /Test, Maintenance.\n
Mistakes found early in the SDLC are much less expensive to correct than those found later.\n
The cost of developing software is not spread equally over the phases, Maintenance is the most costly.\n
Project Management Tools: Gantt Chart, UML, Daily Log, Weekly Reports\n
Gantt Chart: \n Developed by mechanical engineer Henry Gantt in the 1910’s \n   Tool typically used by people working on a large project like the Hoover Dam \n Helps project managers to visualize, schedule, and track scheduled as well as actual progress of projects\n
UML (Unified Modeling Language): \n Visually specifies parts of a system \n Complex software designs are much more easily described through UML than textually \n
